## Customer_Lifetime_Value_Calculation

Customer Lifetime Value means a customer's life time in a company's purchase history.

This means the monetary value of a customer during its relation with the company.

If we know the benefit that a customer brings to the company than it is easier to manage the relations.

We need to know which way is more costly; keeping the current customers or trying to find new customers?

To be able to measure this we have to calculate a customer lifetime value and try to find a new strategy.
